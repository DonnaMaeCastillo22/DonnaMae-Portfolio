            <h2>Educational Journey</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;My educational journey has been a foundational pillar in shaping my career path. Starting with primary education,<br> I developed essential skills in reading, writing, and arithmetic, which formed the base for future learning. <br>High
                school introduced me to a broader array of subjects, allowing me to identify my interests and strengths.
                <br>In College provided a more specialized education where I delved deeper into my chosen field of study. <br>This period was crucial in honing my analytical and critical thinking skills through rigorous coursework and <br> practical experiences
                such as research projects, and group collaborations.
